# BREAST-CANCER
# Logistic Regression Model using Scikit-Learn

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression** using Python and `scikit-learn`. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and threshold tuning.

## Features
- Load and preprocess a **binary classification dataset**.
- Standardize features for better performance.
- Train a **Logistic Regression model** using `sklearn.linear_model`.
- Evaluate using **Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.
- Tune threshold and explain the **sigmoid function**.

## Dataset
You can use any dataset relevant to the task, such as the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**. Ensure the dataset contains numerical features for classification.

## Installation
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage
Run the Python script to train and evaluate the model:

python logistic_regression.py


Code Structure
logistic_regression.py – Contains the pipeline for training and evaluating the model.

data/ – Store your dataset here.

README.md – Guide for repository usage.

Model Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix – Shows how well the model classifies positive and negative instances.

Precision & Recall – Measures classification performance.

ROC-AUC Score – Evaluates probability-based predictions.

Threshold Tuning & Sigmoid Function
The sigmoid function converts model outputs into probabilities:

𝜎(𝑧)=1/(1+𝑒−𝑧)

By adjusting the classification threshold, we can modify decision-making for predictions.
